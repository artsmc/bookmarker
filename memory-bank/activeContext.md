# Active Context

## Current Focus: Phase 2 - Pocket Data Import

Phase 1 (Core Bookmarker Functionality) has been successfully completed. The application now has a fully functional bookmark management system with authentication, CRUD operations, search functionality, and a polished UI. The current focus is transitioning to Phase 2: implementing Pocket data import functionality.

## Recent Accomplishments

1. **Complete Authentication System**: Email/password authentication working with Convex Auth
2. **Full CRUD Operations**: Users can add, view, search, and delete bookmarks
3. **Responsive UI**: BookmarkerDashboard component with mobile-friendly design
4. **Real-time Updates**: Convex subscriptions provide instant UI updates
5. **Search Functionality**: Real-time search across titles, descriptions, and tags
6. **Tag System**: Flexible bookmark organization with tag support

## Next Steps

1. **Pocket Import UI**: Build file upload interface for Pocket ZIP exports
2. **Data Processing**: Create Convex mutation to parse and import Pocket data
3. **Data Transformation**: Map Pocket data structure to Bookmarker schema
4. **Bulk Import Optimization**: Handle large datasets efficiently
5. **Import Progress Feedback**: Provide user feedback during import process

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Current Architecture Strengths
- **Convex Real-time**: Automatic UI updates eliminate manual refresh needs
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript provides excellent developer experience
- **Component Architecture**: BookmarkerDashboard is self-contained and maintainable
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS utilities

### Technical Patterns in Use
- **Server State Management**: Convex queries handle all data fetching and caching
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe forms
- **UI Composition**: Shadcn UI components provide consistent, accessible interface
- **Authentication Flow**: Convex Auth seamlessly integrates with React components

### Important Implementation Insights
- **Database Indexes**: Proper indexing on `userId` and `status` fields enables efficient queries
- **Authorization Pattern**: All mutations verify user ownership before data modification
- **Search Implementation**: Client-side filtering provides instant search results
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error states with user-friendly messaging

### Learnings from Phase 1
- **Convex Development Flow**: Hot reloading and real-time updates accelerate development
- **Shadcn UI Integration**: Copy-paste components reduce dependency management overhead
- **TypeScript Benefits**: Auto-generated types from Convex schema prevent runtime errors
- **Responsive Grid Layout**: CSS Grid with Tailwind provides flexible bookmark display

## Project Insights

### What's Working Well
- **Developer Experience**: Convex + Next.js + TypeScript provides excellent DX
- **Real-time Features**: Users see changes instantly without page refreshes
- **Component Reusability**: Shadcn UI components are highly composable
- **Performance**: Convex queries are optimized and cached automatically

### Areas for Future Enhancement
- **Metadata Extraction**: Playwright integration for automatic title/description fetching
- **Link Validation**: Scheduled functions to check bookmark health
- **Advanced Search**: Full-text search with ranking and filtering
- **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select for batch bookmark management

### Technical Debt Considerations
- **Minor TypeScript Warnings**: Some non-blocking type issues in components
- **Error Boundaries**: Could benefit from React error boundaries for better UX
- **Loading States**: More sophisticated loading indicators for better perceived performance
- **Offline Support**: Progressive Web App features for offline bookmark access
