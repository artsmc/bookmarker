    *   Add performance monitoring

## Current Status

*   **Date**: July 9, 2025
*   **Phase**: Transitioning from Phase 1 (Complete) to Phase 2 (Pocket Import)
*   **Application State**: Fully functional bookmark management system
*   **Development URLs**: 
    - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
    - Convex Dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:6790/?d=anonymous-bookmarker-app
*   **Git Repository**: https://github.com/artsmc/bookmarker.git

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)
*   **TypeScript Warnings**: Some minor type issues in components that don't affect functionality
*   **Loading States**: Could benefit from more sophisticated loading indicators
*   **Error Boundaries**: Missing React error boundaries for better error handling

### Future Considerations
*   **Offline Support**: Progressive Web App features for offline access
*   **Advanced Search**: Full-text search with ranking and relevance scoring
*   **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select functionality for batch bookmark management
*   **Data Export**: Allow users to export their bookmark collections

## Architecture Decisions Made

### Successful Patterns
*   **Convex Real-time**: Automatic UI updates provide excellent user experience
*   **Component Architecture**: Self-contained components promote maintainability
*   **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript prevents runtime errors
*   **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach ensures broad device compatibility

### Lessons Learned
*   **Database Indexing**: Proper indexes on `userId` and `status` fields are crucial for performance
*   **Authorization Pattern**: Consistent user ownership verification in all mutations
*   **Search Implementation**: Client-side filtering provides instant search results
*   **Development Workflow**: Parallel frontend/backend development accelerates iteration
