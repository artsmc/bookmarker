# Product Context

## Problem

The modern internet user is inundated with information. Bookmarking interesting links is a common practice, but existing solutions can be disorganized, lack intelligence, and often fail to prevent "link rot" (where links become broken over time). Users need a better way to not only save and organize their digital findings but also to rediscover and get value from them.

## Solution

This project aims to build an intelligent, open-source bookmarker that addresses these problems. It will provide a robust platform for users to save, tag, and manage their bookmarks.

Key differentiators will be:
*   **Automated Link Maintenance:** A pipeline will automatically check for broken or redirected links, ensuring the user's collection remains clean and up-to-date.
*   **Intelligent Discovery:** By integrating with the Gemini API, the application will provide personalized recommendations for new content based on the user's existing bookmarks.
*   **Seamless Data Import:** Users can easily import their entire history from Pocket, making the transition to this new platform frictionless.

## User Experience Goals

*   **Effortless Onboarding:** A simple "Sign in with Google" flow and an easy Pocket import process.
*   **Fast and Intuitive Interface:** A clean, modern UI built with Next.js and Shadcn UI for a smooth and responsive experience.
*   **Value-Added Features:** The discovery page should feel like a personalized content curator, not just a list of links.
